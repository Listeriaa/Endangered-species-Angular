## Work in Progress...

Re-working the app about endangered species to train myself on Angular (framework that I'll be using in an internship starting in march 2022)

## WIP

- **Feb 2022**: Managed to get list of species from API (Observable...)
- **Feb 2022**: Managed to attribute a threat category with options (french name, bootstrap class...) depending on the threat category sent by the API
- **Feb 2022**: Managed to pass a specie on the componant Card
- **Feb 2022**: Managed to attribute bootstrap classes and french phylogenic class depending on props
- **Feb 2022**: Translation for name, and threats OK 
- **Feb 2022** : trying to deploy on heroku (issue with env Angular not building)
## Challenge 

- First time I'm using Typescript and it is very challenging for me.

## TODO

- I would like to add a filter on categories.
