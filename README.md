## Work in Progress...

Re-working the app about endangered species to train myself on Angular (framework that I'll be using in an internship starting in march 2022)

## WIP

- Managed to get list of species from API (Observable...)
- Managed to attribute a threat category with options (french name, bootstrap class...) depending on the threat category sent by the API
- Managed to pass a specie on the componant Card

## Challenge 

- First time I'm using Typescript and it is very challenging for me.

## TODO

- Still a lot to do, especially the collapse "more info" (need another fetch to API to get french name and type of threats).
- I would like to add a filter on categories
