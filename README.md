## Work in Progress...

Re-working the app about endangered species to train myself on Angular (framework that I'll be using in an internship starting in march 2022).

## WIP

- Managed to get list of species from API (Observable...)
- Managed to attribute a threat category with options (french name, bootstrap class...) depending on the threat category sent by the API
- Managed to pass a specie on the componant Card
- Managed to attribute bootstrap classes and french phylogenic class depending on props
- Translation for name, and threats OK 
- Issues with Heroku deployment and env variables, which are gitignored => managed with yargs and dotenv
- BUT no SSL free certificate on Heroku so I also deployed the app on my own O2switch server

## Challenge 

- First time I'm using Typescript and it is very challenging for me.

## TODO

- I would like to add a filter on categories.
- At the moment, as my app targets french users, a call to IUCN API is made for all the cards to get the type of specie (fish, plant...) in order to translate it. I believe it's making the app running slow. I would like to find a way to only fetch the data if the card is in the user's view...
